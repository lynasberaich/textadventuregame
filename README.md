# Escape from the Forbidden Corridor (Mini Text Adventure)

This tiny game is a Harry Potter–inspired puzzle: you’ve snuck out after curfew and must escaoe the Forbidden Corridor and get back safely. There are three locations and three items, you must unlock a blocked path using a key, put Fluffy to sleep using a potion, and overcoming darkness with Lumos before opening the final trapdoor to escape. I picked this topic because I have always loved Harry Potter and the Hogwarts setting has memorable locations and objects that's fun to play around with in a compact interactive fiction format.
